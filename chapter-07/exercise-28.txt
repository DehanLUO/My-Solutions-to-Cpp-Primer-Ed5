/*
 * Exercise 7.28: What would happen in the previous exercise if the return type
 * of move, set, and display was Screen rather than Screen&?
 */

/*
 * If Move(), Set(), and Display() returned Screen instead of Screen&:
 *
 * Behaviour changes:
 * - Each call would create a TEMPORARY COPY of the Screen object
 * - Modifications would apply to the copy, not the original object
 * - Method chaining would operate on successive temporary objects
