/*
 * Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.
 */

/*
 * 1. Nullability: Pointers can bu nullptr/NULL. Reference (lvalue reference)
 * must refer to a valid object.
 * 2. Reassignment: Pointers can be reassigned to point to different objects.
 * References cannot be reseated once bound.
 * 3. Syntax: Use `*` to declare/dereference a pointer, and `&` to get
 * an address. Use `&` to declare a reference, but no special syntax to use it.
 * 4. Initialization: Pointers can be declared without initialization.
 * References must be initialized when declared.
 * 5. Memory semantics: Pointers are actual variables that hold addresses.
 * References are alias; they typically do not occupy their own storage.
