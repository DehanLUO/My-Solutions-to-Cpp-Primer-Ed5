/*
 * Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a
 * valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?
 */

/*
 * You cannot reliably determine whether a pointer points to a valid object just
 * from the pointer value itself.
 *
 * c++ does not provide built-in runtime mechanisms to track the validity of a
 * pointer. A pointer is just a memory address, and:
 * - That memory might be valid or not.
 * - It might point to a deallocated object (dangling pointer).
 * - It might point to a memory region that is not owned by your program,
 *   causing undefined behavior if accessd.
 * - It might point to valid memory but not to a properly constructed object.
 *
 * What you can check for nullptr with `p != nullptr`
