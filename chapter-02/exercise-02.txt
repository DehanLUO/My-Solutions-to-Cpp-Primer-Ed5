/*
 * Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for
 * the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.
 */

/*
 * To calculate a mortgage payment in a banking system, **precision** is more
 * important than convenience. Since floating-point types like `float` and
 * `double` can introduce rounding errors, they should be avoided in financial
 * calculations. Instead, we can use **integer types**, such as `long long`, to
 * represent all monetary values in the smallest currency unit, such as cents or
 * even smaller.
 *
 * We store the interest rate as a **scaled integer**, For example, instrad of
 * representing 3.75% as 0.0375, we store it as 3750, assuming five decimal
 * places of precision (i.e., 3750 means 0.0375). When calculating interest, we
 * must scale accordingly (e.g., divide by 100000) to recover the actual rate
 * during arithmetic. This avoids the use of floating-point types and maintains
 * exact precision.
