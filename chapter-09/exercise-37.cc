   *   the concept of a pre-allocated buffer does not apply.
   * - Consequently, a std::list does not need, and cannot benefit from, the
   *   notion of capacity.

   * of N elements. Its storage is:
   * - Contiguous: Like std::vector, the elements are laid out sequentially in
   *   memory.
   * - Static: The size is determined at compile time and cannot be changed at
   *   runtime.
   * Given that the number of elements is fixed and known at compile time, there
   * is no distinction between the container's size and its capacity - both are
   * always equal to N.
   * - Therefore, a separate capacity() member would serve no additional
   *   purpose.
   * - The size() member is sufficient for all practical uses.
