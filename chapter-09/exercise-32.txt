/*
 * Exercise 9.32: In the program onpage 354 would it be legal to write the call
 * to insert as follows? If not, why not?
 *     iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);
 */

/*
 * The proposed change is not legal and would result in undefined behaviour.
 * The compiler could:
 * - Evaluate *it++ fisrt (incrementing iter before insert)
 * - Or evaluate iter first for the insert position
