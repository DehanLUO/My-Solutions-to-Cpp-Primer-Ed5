/*
 * Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the
 * input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?
 */

/*
 * 1. All input values equal:
 * The `else` branch in the `while` loop is never executed. The loop continues
 * until input ends, and the final output statement prints the single unique
 * value and its total count.
 *
 * 2. No duplicated values:
 * The `if` branch in the `while` loop is never executed. For each value, the
 * `else` branch runs, printing the value and a count of `1`. After the loop
 * ends, the final output prints the last value (again) with a count of `1`.
