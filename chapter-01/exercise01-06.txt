/*
 * Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
 * std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
 *           << " and " << v2;
 *           << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
 * If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why
 * not? How would you fix it?
 */

/*
 * The given code fragment is not legal. The semicolons at the end of the first
 * two lines terminate the statements, making the second and the third lines
 * into new statements. However, these lines begin with the output operator `<<`
 * without specifying an output stream object.
 *
 * To fix this, we need to add `std::out` before each `<<` opeator on the
 * continud lines, or better yet, write the entire output as a single statement
 * without intermediate semicolons. The correct version woule be:
 *
 * std::cout << "The sum of " << v1
 *           << " and " << v2
 *           << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
