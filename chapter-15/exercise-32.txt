/*
 * Exercise 15.32: What happens when an object of type Query is copied, moved,
 * assigned, and destroyed?
 */

/*
 * Query class uses compiler-generated default operations:
 * - Copy constructor: shares ownership via shared_ptr copy
 * - Move constructor: transfers ownership via shared_ptr move
 * - Copy assignment: shares ownership, may release previous
 * - Move assignment: transfer ownership, may release previous
 * - Destructor: decreases reference count, may destroy object
