 * Exercise 15.18: Given the classes from page 612 and page 613, and assuming
 * each object has the type specified in the comments, determine which of these
 * assignments are legal. Explain why those that are illegal arenâ€™t allowed:
 *     Base *p = &d1; // d1 has type Pub_Derv
 *     p = &d2;       // d2 has type Priv_Derv
 *     p = &d3;       // d3 has type Prot_Derv
 *     p = &dd1;      // dd1 has type Derived_from_Public
 *     p = &dd2;      // dd2 has type Derived_from_Private
 *     p = &dd3;      // dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected
