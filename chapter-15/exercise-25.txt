/*
 * Exercise 15.25: Why did we define a default constructor for Disc_quote? What
 * effect, if any, would removing that constructor have on the behavior of
 * Bulk_quote?
 */

/*
 * 1. WHY DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR IS NEEDED:
 * a) DERIVED CLASS DEFAULT CONSTRUCTION:
 *    - BulkQuote default constructor requires DiscQuote default constructor
 *    - Derived classes must initialize their base classes
 *    - Without default constructor, BulkQuote() would not compile
 * b) CONTAINER USAGE AND OBJECT CREATION:
 *    - Default construction enables use in containers:
 *      std::vector<BulkQuote> quotes(10); // Needs default constructor
 *    - Allows array creation and default initialization
 * c) SERIALIZATION AND FACTORY PATTERNS:
 *    - Objects may be created before their data is available
 *    - Default construction followed by assignment is common
 *    - Enables flexible object creation patterns
 *
 * 2. IMPACT ON BulkQuote BEHAVIOR:
 * a) COMPILATION ERRORS:
 *    - BulkQuote default constructor would not compile
 *    - Any attempt to default-construct BulkQuote would fail
 * b) CONTAINER LIMITATIONS:
 *    - Could not use BulkQuote in std::vector without default constructor
 *    - std::vector<BulkQuote> would require explicit initialization
 * c) REDUCED FLEXIBILITY:
 *    - Would force all BulkQuote objects to be parameterized
 *    - Eliminates possibility of default-initialized objects
