/*
 * Exercise 15.33: What about objects of type Query_base?
 */

/*
 * NO EXPLICIT COPY/MOVE OPERATIONS DECLARED
 * Compiler will generate default versions:
 * - QueryBase(const QueryBase&) = default;
 * - QueryBase(QueryBase&&) = default;
 * - QueryBase& operator=(const QueryBase&) = default;
 * - QueryBase& operator=(QueryBase&&) = default;
 *
 * QueryBase class properties:
 * - Abstract base class (has pure virtual functions)
 * - No data members
 * - No explicit copy/move operations declared
 * - Uses compiler-generated default operations
 * - Virtual destructor for polymorphic cleanup
 * Since QueryBase has no data members:
 * - Copy construction: Nothing happens (no members to copy)
 * - Move construction: Nothing happens (no members to move)
 * - Copy assignment: Nothing happens (no members to assign)
 * - Move assignment: Nothing happens (no members to move)
 * - Destruction: Nothing happens (no resources to release)
