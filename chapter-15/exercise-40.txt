/*
 * Exercise 15.40: In the OrQuery eval function what would happen if its rhs
 * member returned an empty set? What if its lhs member did so? What if both rhs
 * and lhs returned empty sets?
 */

/*
 * If the rhs operand returns an empty set:
 * - The result of OrQuery will be exactly the same as the lhs result set
 * - Since the union operation treats the empty set as a neutral element, it
 *   does not affect the final outcome
 * If the lhs operand returns an empty set:
 * - The result of OrQuery will be exactly the same as the rhs result set
 * - Again, the empty set has no effect on the union
 * If both lhs and rhs return empty sets:
 * - The result of OrQuery will also be an empyt set
 * - The union of two empty sets is still empty
