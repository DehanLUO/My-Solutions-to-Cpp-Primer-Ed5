/*
 * Exercise 14.29: We did not define a const version of the increment and
 * decrement operators. Why not?
 */

/*
 * Increment/decrement operators modify the object's state:
 * - ++ptr changes ptr.curr_
 * - --ptr changes ptr.curr_
 *
 * const member functions cannot modify object state:
 * - const qualifier promises no state modification
 * - Increment/decrement inherently violate this promise
