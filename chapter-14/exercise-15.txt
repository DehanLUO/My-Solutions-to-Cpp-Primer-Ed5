/*
 * Rationale Against Arithmetic Operators for Book Class
 * 1. Semantic Inappropriateness:
 *    Books are immutable entities with fixed metadata properties.
 *    Arithmetic operations lack meaningful interpretation:
 *    - Book + Book = ? (Concatenation? Merging? Nonsensical)
 *    - Book * scaler = ? (Scaling page count? Illogical)
 *    - Book - Book = ? (Difference operation? Undefined)
 *
 * 2. Domain Model Integrity
 *    Core book attributes are invariant:
 *    - Title: Unique identifier (cannot be modified mathematically)
 *    - Author: Creative attribution (not quantifiable)
 *    - ISBN: International standard (arithmetic operations invalid)
 *    - Publication Year: Historical fact (immutable)
