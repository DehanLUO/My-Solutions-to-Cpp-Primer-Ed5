 * Exercise 14.48: Determine whether the class you used in exercise 7.40 from

/*
 * Book should have a conversion to bool.
 * 1. Natural Boolean Context:
 *    - Books often need to be checked for validity/emptiness
 *    - if (book) is more natural than if (book.IsValid())
 *    - while (library.GetNextBook()) is intuitive
 * 2. Standard Library Compatibility:
 *    - Works well with algorithms that check for "truthy" values
 *    - Can be used in conditional statements naturally
 * 3. Semantic Meaning:
 *    - A Book object can meaningfully represent validity state
 *    - Default-constructed books are "false" (invalid/empty)
 *    - Properly constructed books are "true" (valid)
 *
 * The operator should be explicit
 * 1. Prevents Unintended Conversions:
 *    - Avoids implicit conversion to int in arithmetic expressions
 *    - Prevents book + 5 from compiling (which would be nonsense)
 * 2. Maintains Type Safety:
 *    - Requires explicit static_cast<bool> when conversion is intended
 *    - if (book) still works due to contextually conversion to bool
 *    - explicit operator bool still works in if/while/for contexts
