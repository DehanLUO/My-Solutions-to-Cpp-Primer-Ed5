/*
 * Exercise 14.46: Explain whether defining these Sales_data conversion
 * operators is a good idea and whether they should be explicit.
 */

/*
 * OPERATOR-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
 * operator std::string():
 *   - Returns ISBN, which is reasonable for string representation
 *   - However, might be confusing: is it the object's string
 *     representation or just the ISBN?
 *   - Better alternative: provide toString() method explicitly
 *
 * operator double():
 *   - Returns revenue, but this is ambiguous
 *   - Should it return revenue, average price, or something else?
 *   - Could lead to incorrect assumptions about the numeric value
 *
 * WHY EXPLICIT IS NECESSARY:
 * 1. Prevents accidental implicit conversions that could hide bugs
 * 2. Makes the conversion intentional and visible in code
 * 3. Avoids ambiguity in overload resolution
 * 4. Maintains type safety and code clarity
 *
 * EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS WITHOUT EXPLICIT:
 * Without explicit, these would compile but be dangerous:
 * Sales_data book("123-456");
 * std::string s = book;          // Implicit conversion
 * double revenue = book;         // Implicit conversion
 * process_string(book);          // Might not be intended
 *
 * WITH EXPLICIT (current safe design):
 * Sales_data book("123-456");
 * std::string s = static_cast<std::string>(book);  // Explicit
 * double revenue = static_cast<double>(book);      // Explicit
 * // process_string(book);                     // Error: no implicit conversion
 *
 */
/*
 * KEY CONCLUSIONS:
 * 1. The current design with explicit conversion operators is SAFE
 *    but should be used judiciously.
 * 2. Conversion operators should generally be AVOIDED unless they
 *    provide clear, unambiguous value that named methods cannot.
 * 3. When provided, they MUST be explicit to prevent hidden bugs.
 * 4. Consider whether named methods (GetRevenue(), GetIsbn()) would
 *    provide clearer intent and better maintainability.
 * 5. Document the semantic meaning of conversions thoroughly.
