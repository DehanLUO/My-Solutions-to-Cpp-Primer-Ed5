 * Exercise 14.11: What, if anything, is wrong with the following Sales_data
 * input operator? What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the
 * previous exercise?
 *     istream& operator>>(istream& in, Sales_data& s) {
 *       double price;
 *       in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
 *       s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
 *       return in;
 *     }

/*
 * The extraction sequence incorrectly parse malformed input like "10 24.95
 * 0-210-99999-9" because:
 * - bookNo captures "10" (should reject non-ISBN formats)
 * - units_sold takes 24 from "24.95" (silently truncating decimal)
 * - price reads ".95" (valid float but semantically wrong)
