/*
 * Exercise 13.38: We did not use copy and swap to define the Message assignment
 * operator. Why do you suppose this is so?
 */

/*
 * If the copy-and-swap idiom were employed for the Message assignment operator,
 * the execution sequence would entail the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Parameter Initialization:
 *    - The assignment operator’s parameter (rhs) is of type Message (not a
 *      reference), triggering a copy construction.
 *    - The copy constructor duplicates rhs.contents and rhs.folders, then
 *      invokes add_to_Folders() to register the new Message object with all
 *      Folders in rhs.folders.
 * 2. Swap Operation:
 *    - swap(*this, rhs) executes:
 *      - Removal Phase: Iterates over both objects’ folders, invoking remMsg()
 *        to sever bidirectional links.
 *      - Member Swap: Efficiently swaps contents (via std::string::swap) and
 *        folders (via std::set::swap).
 *      - Reinsertion Phase: Re-establishes links by calling addMsg() for each
 *        Folder in the updated folders sets.
 *    - Destruction of Temporary:
 *      - Upon scope exit, rhs (now holding the original *this data) is
 *        destroyed, invoking ~Message().
 *      - The destructor calls remove_from_Folders(), redundantly removing the
 *        original data from all Folders.
 *
 * Performance Deficiencies
 * While semantically correct, this approach introduces significant
 * inefficiencies:
 * - Redundant Copies: The pass-by-value parameter necessitates a full copy of
 *   rhs, including duplicate string allocation and set construction.
 * - Double Updates: Each Folder in rhs.folders is updated twice (during copy
 *   construction and swap), followed by a third update during destruction.
 * - Unnecessary Self-Assignment Overhead: Even self-assignment (m1 = m1) incurs
 *   costly temporary creation and destruction.
 *
 * Advantages of the Standard Implementation
 *
 * The current implementation (using a const Message& parameter) optimizes
 * performance by:
 * 1. Direct Modification:
 *    - Explicitly removes *this from its current Folders once via
 *      remove_from_Folders().
 *    - Copies rhs.contents and rhs.folders in place.
 *    - Adds *this to new Folders once via add_to_Folders().
 * 2. Avoided Overhead:
 *    - No temporary object creation or destruction.
 *    - Minimal Folder updates (one removal + one insertion pass).
 * 3. Exception Safety:
 *    - Strong guarantee is maintained: if copying fails, *this emains detached
 *      from all Folders (a valid state).
 *
 * Conclusion
 *
 * The copy-and-swap idiom, though elegant for resource-managing types like
 * std::vector, is suboptimal for Message due to its bidirectional Folder
 * relationships. The standard implementation prioritizes efficiency by:
 * - Eliminating redundant copies.
 * - Minimizing Folder update operations.
 * - Retaining clarity and exception safety.
 * This design aligns with C++ best practices for types with complex invariants,
 * where explicit control over resource management outweighs the syntactic
 * brevity of copy-and-swap.
