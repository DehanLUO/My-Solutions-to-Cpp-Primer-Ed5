/*
 * Exercise 13.21: Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes need to
 * define their own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not,
 * why not? Implement whichever copy-control operations you think these classes
 * require.
 */

/*
 * Defaults Are Sufficient For TextQuery:
 * 1. The shared_ptr member handles all resource management
 * 2. Default copy operations correctly share ownership
 * 3. No additional resources need management
 * 4. Move operations would break the intended sharing semantics
 */

/*
 * Defaults Are Sufficient For QueryResult:
 * 1. weak_ptr and primitive members are safely copyable
 * 2. Move operations are safe and improve efficiency
 * 3. No special cleanup needed in destructor
 * 4. Maintains consistent behavior with pointer semantics
