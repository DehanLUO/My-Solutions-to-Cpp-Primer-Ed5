 * Exercise 13.22: Assume that we want HasPtr to behave like a value. That is,
 * each object should have its own copy of the string to which the objects
 * point. Weâ€™ll show the definitions of the copy-control members in the next
 * section. However, you already know everything you need to know to implement
 * these members. Write the HasPtr copy constructor and copy-assignment operator
 * before reading on.
