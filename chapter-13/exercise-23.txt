/*
 * Exercise 13.23: Compare the copy-control members that you wrote for the
 * solutions to the previous sectionâ€™s exercises to the code presented here. Be
 * sure you understand the differences, if any, between your code and ours.
 */

/*
 * The copy-control members I implemented for the HasPtr class are functionally
 * equivalent to those presented in the book. Both versions perform a deep copy
 * of the dynamically allocated string and ensure proper resource management.
 * However, there are a few stylistic and structural differences.
 *
 * My implementation includes a self-assignment check in the copy
 * assignment operator, which enhances robustness and is generally recommended,
 * even though the book version omits it.
 *
 * Overall, there are no semantic or behavioural differences between the two
 * implementations regarding copy control. My version adds helpful commentary
 * and interface enhancements, while the book version remains minimal and
 * focused.
