/*
 * Exercise 12.18: Why doesnâ€™t shared_ptr have a release member?
 */

/*
 * unique_ptr::release() releases ownership of the managed object and returns
 * the raw pointer without deleting it.
 *
 * Fundamental Design Difference:
 * - unique_ptr: Exclusive ownership (one owner)
 * - shared_ptr: Shared ownership (multiple owners)
 *
 * Why no release():
 * - Ownership Complexity: With multiple shared owners, releasing to a raw
 *   pointer would violate RAII priciples.
 * - Reference Counting: The shared control block makes ownership transfer
 *   ambiguous.
 * - Safety Guarantees: Would break automatic deletion when last shared_ptr
 *   expires.
