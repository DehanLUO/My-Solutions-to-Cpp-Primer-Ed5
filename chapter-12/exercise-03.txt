/*
 * Exercise 12.3: Does this class need const versions of push_back and pop_back?
 * If so, add them. If not, why arenâ€™t they needed?
 */

/*
 * push_back and pop_back are modifying operations
 * Const member functions should not modify object state
 * Providing const versions would violate const-correctness
