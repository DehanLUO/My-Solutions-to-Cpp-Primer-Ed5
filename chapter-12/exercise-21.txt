/*
 * Exercise 12.21: We could have written StrBlobPtrâ€™s deref member as follows:
 *     std::string& deref() const {
 *       return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr];
 *     }
 * Which version do you think is better and why?
 */

/*
 * Prefer the original version for:
 *
 * Readability:
 * - Original: Clear separation of concerns
 * - Alternative: More compact but potentially harder to debug
 *
 * Debugging:
 * - Original: Easier to inspect intermediate p value
 * - Alternative: Harder to set breakpoints on the access operation
 *
 * Performance:
 * Both version generate identical optimized code. No meaningful difference in
 * runtime.
 *
 * Maintainability:
 * - Original: More self-documenting
 * - Alternative: More concise but less explicit
 *
 * Exception Safety:
 * Both versions provide identical guarantees. Check() throws before any access
 * occurs.
