/*
 * Exercise 10.40: What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What
 * about reverse or unique?
 */

/*
 * 1. std::copy(first, last, d_first):
 *    - Input requirements:
 *      * first, last: InputIterator (at minimum)
 *    - Output requirements:
 *      * d_first: OutputIterator (at minimum)
 *    - Typical usage: Works with all iterator categories
 *
 * 2. std::reverse(first, last):
 *    - Requirements: BidirectionalIterator
 *    - Must support -- operation
 *    - Won't work with forward_list (only forward iterators)
 *
 * 3. std::unique(first, last):
 *    - Requirements: ForwardIterator
 *    - Must support multi-pass and read/write
 *    - Works with vector, deque, list, but not input streams
