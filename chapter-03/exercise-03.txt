/*
 * Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string
 * input operator and in the getline function.
 */

/*
 * `>>` string input operator
 * - Skips leading whitespace
 * - Stops reading at the next whitespace character
 *
 * `getline`
 * - Reads all characters until a delimiter (default '\n') is encountered
 * - The delimiter is removed from the stream but not stored in the string
